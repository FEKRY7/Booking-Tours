Here're some of the project's best features:

Authentication: User authentication is implemented to secure the API endpoints and manage user access. Users can sign up, log in, and receive authentication tokens for subsequent requests.

Hotel Management: The API allows for managing hotels, including creating, updating, and deleting hotel records. Each hotel can have multiple rooms associated with it

Room : Users can search for available rooms based on specified criteria such as check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, and room type. They can then proceed to book a room of their choice.

Booking Management : Once a room is booked, the API provides functionality to manage the bookings. This includes retrieving booking details, updating booking information, and canceling bookings.
